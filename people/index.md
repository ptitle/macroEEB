## People

#### Pascal Title (Principal Investigator)

{%

  image="people/images/PascalTitle.jpg"
  text="Pascal Title is an evolutionary ecologist who integrates geographic distributions, phylogenies and trait data to better understand global diversity patterns and the processes that have generated them. He earned his PhD at the [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb) and the [Museum of Zoology](https://lsa.umich.edu/ummz/herps.html), and his Masters at [San Diego State University](https://kevinburnslab.com/). He was also a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the [Environmental Resilience Institute at Indiana University](https://eri.iu.edu/). By combining species occurrences and environmental spatial data with macroevolutionary and macroecological approaches, he explore how biodiversity patterns are structured along geographic and environmental gradients, and how historical contingency has generated the patterns we observe today.

  [You can find his CV here](./PTitle_CV.pdf).

  You can contact him at pascal.title [at] stonybrook.edu."

### Postdoctoral Researchers

#### Leroy Núñez

{%

  image="people/images/LeroyNunez.JPG"
  text="Leroy Núñez is an evolutionary biologist and postdoctoral associate in Pascal Title's Lab at the Department of Ecology and Evolution in Stony Brook University. Dr. Núñez received his Ph.D. in Comparative Biology at the Richard Gilder Graduate School at the American Museum of Natural History where he worked in Frank Burbrink's lab on the phylogenomics and evolutionary patterns of North American watersnakes. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Florida where he worked on phylogeography of invasive reptiles and amphibians in Florida while also working in the Florida Museum of Natural History. Dr. Núñez is primarily interested in the underlying evolutionary dynamics that allow lineages to exploit ecological opportunity, using an integrative and organism-focused approach in exploring this topic.

### Graduate Students


#### Jorge Carballo Morales

  height="100%"
  text="Jorge studied Tropical Biology and Natural Resource Management at the Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica. He earned a Master's in Biology at Towson University, where he studied diet evolution in bats globally, the phylogenetic structure in the diet of fruit-eating bats, and the association between their diversification and the plant families present in their diet. In general, he is interested in exploring the diet of bats and other mammals from a macroevolutionary, ecological, and biogeographical perspective. Jorge enjoys teaching and has collaborated in several field courses with the Organization for Tropical Studies in Costa Rica. Outside of academia, he enjoys running and biking. Learn more about Jorge on his [website](https://jcarmor.netlify.app/)."

  text="Lauren has broad interests in the conservation, ecology, evolutionary history and diversity of herpetofauna. Her current research applies a multidisciplinary approach to investigate species’ vulnerability and adaptive responses to climate change. Before joining Stony Brook, she earned her B.S. in Zoology with Herpetology and an M.S. in Biological Sciences from Bangor University."
